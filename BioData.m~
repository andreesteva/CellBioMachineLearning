% BioData
% this class reads a .fcs file and stores its data in a matrix
% Purpose: abstract away the logistical handling of the fcs data and be
%   able to merge multiple sets of data as needed
% 
% BioData is a simpler and more higher-level version of CellData, intended
% to work for a variety of data sets (including Karen's latest Cancer Data
% set as of January 2014
%
% FCS file data format
%   contains a large matrix where rows correspond to individual cells and
%   the columns correspond to some variable. This variable is usually a
%   protein, in which case the matrix entry would be the counts of that
%   protein in the processed cell. Other variables include time, etc.
%
%   contains a header struct, which labels the columns of the matrix as
%   well as contains data like the name of the cell type
